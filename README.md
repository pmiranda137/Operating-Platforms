# Operating-Platforms

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client with an Android based application who wanted to expand to a web-based application serving multiple platforms. 
    
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
When developing this document, I believe I did particularly well comparing and contrasting different operating systems. I tried to be very thorough and unbiased in acknowledging pros and cons of Windows, Linux, and Mac. 
    
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document was helpful when devolping the code because it laid out the expectations of the client as well as the product and what was to be created in the end.
    
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to outline more design contraints and be a bit more detailed as to why they are listed. 
    
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs were implemented throughout the entire design document. It is important to keep these needs in mind because you want to deliver a relevant and useful product in the end that the client will be pleased with. 
    
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software with the user's requirements in mind. In the future I would analyze user needs, list design constraints explicitly, and be sure I understood what was being asked for by the client so I could deliver a sufficient software application.
